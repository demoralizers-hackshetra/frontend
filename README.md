# Frontend

This repo hosts the frontend for the Excalibur 2023 project. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript (CSS built using Tailwind CSS framework) to build a good frontend to the website to allow users to have a good, functional experience while using the website

Right now we don't need a specialized server, the JavaScript redirects should be enough, so clone the repo and run ```python3 -m http.server``` to run the frontend. Then go to 127.0.0.1:8000/homepage.html to load the website
